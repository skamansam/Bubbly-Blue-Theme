/* ie6.css:
 * Bubbly Blue fixes for IE 6 
 * 	by Skaman Sam Tyler <skamansam@gmail.com> [http://rbe.homeip.net]
 * 
 * These stylesheets cascade with each version decrement,
 * so IE 5.5 users are using ie8.css, ie7.css, ie6.css, and ie55.css
 *
 * If you want to edit the styles for IE 5.5, edit ie55.css.
 * 
 * NOTE: I do not have access to IE 6, so I cannot even begin to edit these 
 * styles. If you would like to contribute, please email me. Thanks.

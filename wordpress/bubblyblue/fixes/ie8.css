/* ie8.css:
 * Bubbly Blue fixes for IE 8 
 * 	by Skaman Sam Tyler <skamansam@gmail.com> [http://rbe.homeip.net]
 * 
 * These stylesheets cascade with each version decrement,
 * so IE 5.5 users are using ie8.css, ie7.css, ie6.css, and ie55.css
 *
 * If you want to edit the styles for IE 5, edit ie5.css.
 * 
 * NOTE: You really shouldn't need this file. IE 8 is probably 
 * standards-compliant enough.

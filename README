The bubbly-blue theme is a light-blue theme with green highlights and plenty of 
smooth gradients, creating a subtle 3D effect. This project's goal is to create
this theme for many platforms and applications. So far, these are:

Web Based Applications
web-site [100% complete]
        This is the theme for my web site. It will contain an HTML layout, images, and 
        css for the site.
wordpress [80% complete]
        This is a highly customizable version of the web-site template. Features include
        the ability to change parts of the header, a 3-layer header, and movable header 
        elements.

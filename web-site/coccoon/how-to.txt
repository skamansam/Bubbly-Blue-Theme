[admin_how-to.txt:
		This file is a nearly complete how-to on using the Coccoon web management system, 
	developed for the North Carolina Academy of Science by Samuel C. Tyler. If you have 
	any questions or comments, don't hesitate to email Samuel Tyler at sctyler@uncg.edu 
	or skamansam@gmail.com.]
	
WHAT IS COCCOON?
		Coccoon is an easier way to maintain and update the NCAS web site. The 
	idea is simple: just add content. All the rest is taken care of for you. If
	you are an administrator, just edit a few files  to modify the global look and feel. 
	
ABOUT
		The theory behind coccoon is simple - simplify! All of the files that 
	are local to one of the three schools are in the respective coccoon/ sub-directories.
	All the code that is used for all three schools is kept under the /coccoon_global/ 
	directory at the top-level of the site. Each school has full control of what the look 
	and feel of its site is, while maintaining the same overall layout.
	
TECHNOLOGIES USED
		I have used the Accessible Website Menu by Brothercake (http://www.udm4.com/) 
	to handle the layout of the menus. All other code is written by me (Samuel C. Tyler 
	<sctyler@uncg.edu or skamansam@gmail.com>).
	
STANDARDS-COMPLIANCE
		Coccoon fully validates against the World Wide Web Consortium's (w3c) 
	recommendations and other standards, at http://validator.w3.org/. Use of 
	Internet Explorer is discouraged, because it is NOT a standards-compliant web
	browser. Any browser that is based on the Mozilla engine is recommended (see 
	'TOOLS' section below). However, all the pages look the same in almost all browsers.
	To validate your page, simply click on the icons at the bottom of every page. The 
	icon labelled 'W3C CSS' validates the styles used, and the one labelled 'W3C XHTML 1.0'
	validate the actual html code. Use the html button, then the css button.
	
FILES
		The files structure used is as follows:	
	/coccoon_global/
		This directory stores all of the code that is used by all 3 schools.
	/coccoon_global/admin-how-to.txt
		this document
	/coccoon_global/footer.html 
		The last part of the coccoon structure. Contains ending html and all the 
		information at the bottom of each page.
	/coccoon_global/header.html 
		The first part of the coccoon structure. Contains the logo, beginning html, header tag, etc.
	/coccoon_global/ncas_logo.html
		The NCAS logo.
	/coccoon_global/printLayout.css
		This is the layout used when the user prints a document.
	/coccoon_global/screenLayout.css
		All the Style information that defines the layout of every page, when 
		viewed on a computer screen.
	/coccoon_global/local_dirs.html
		Server-Side Include directives that set the LOCAL_DIR variable that tells 
		where to find each schools home directory. If you want to add a new school 
		or set of similar pages (i.e. a shopping cart), copy an existing coccoon 
		directory there, and edit this file.
	/coccoon_global/udm-control.js,
	/coccoon_global/udm-dom-lite.js,
	/coccoon_global/udm-dom-ultra.js,
	/coccoon_global/udm-dom.js,
	/coccoon_global/udm-mod-keyboard.js,
	/coccoon_global/udm-control.js,
	/coccoon_global/udm-style.css,
	/coccoon_global/udm-style.js
		DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES!!! These files are used by the Accessible Website Menu 
		by Brothercake (http://www.udm4.com/). If you wish to edit these, consult the 
		web site. I will not answer questions regarding these files.	
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/header.html
		This file is for the header text- beside the NCAS logo.
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/local.css
		This file defines all the local fonts and colors
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/menu.html
		This file defines the menu. Read the comments at the beginning of this file for use.
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/udm-custom.html
		This file defines the styles for the udm menus, and is well commented. 
		See http://www.udm4.com/manual/quickstart/ for more information.
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/variables.html
		This file contains several variables for the site - MAINTAINER, MAINTAINER_EMAIL, 
		SCHOOL_ABBREVIATION, SCHOOL_NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE, FAX
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/left_spacer.html,
	$LOCAL_DIR/coccoon/right_spacer.html
		These files are for the content of the right and left padding of the entire page. 
		Useful if you wish to have some advertisements or other information.


HOW TO USE
	All you have to do is place the following code at the top of the page you wish to include:
<!--#set var="PAGE_TITLE" value="NCAS Home" --><!--#include virtual="/coccoon_global/header.html"-->
	...and the following at the bottom:
<!--#include virtual="/coccoon_global/footer.html"  -->
	Do NOT put any <html>, <body>, or <head> tags in your file. In order for the html to validate, 
	the two SSI commands at the top MUST NOT have any space between them or before them.

	<div>
		I have decided to upgrade my server OS to Fedora 11 this past week
		(July 17), and have been having a few problems getting my software configured
		properly. (A new 3rd shift job has made my life hectic right now.) So if
		you have experienced any problems getting connected to any of my services, 
		they should be fixed shortly!

		RBE is migrating to a more robust framework: Ruby on Rails! But first, I have
		to learn it, so I have started to migrate <a href="http://bitengine.rbe.homeip.net">Bit Engine</a>
		to Rails. You can view my progress <a href="http://bitengine.rbe.homeip.net">here</a>. I have
		installed the <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Phusion Passenger</a> apache module to help out!

	<div>
		RBE has a new site design. It uses the awesome jQuery library and removes some bulkier
		javascript libraries. I have also removed Brothercake's Accessible Menu. I hope you enjoy!
